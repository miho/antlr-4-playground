ANTLR-v4 Playground
===================

- Playground for upcoming ANTLR 4 version

- It contains a NetBeans Project for *ANTLR v4* and experimental applications.

> **NOTE**
> I __HATE__ Maven like dependencies. They never work. There is always a missing library.
> That is why ANTLR sources and binary build dependencies are included.

## Compile

Open the `antlr-4` project in NetBeans and build the project.
The final ANTLR library can be found in the `deploy` folder.
Now open one of the NetBeans projects that are located in the experiments folder and run it
